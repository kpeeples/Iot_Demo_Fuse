== What it's all about
This demo is supposed to show a lab-based version of a typical Internet of Things ( IoT )
setup. It follows a 3-Layered architecture of

* Edge: as created of data
* Controller: first level of data processing
* Datacenter: well, the datacenter ...

These layers can - and in this demo will - be made out of a set of
Red Hat JBoss products, each taking over an important part in the IoT landscape

== What has been implemented?
As for now, this demo includes:

 * 1 edge device, which simulates a temperature sensor
 * controller functionality to
  ** transformation of edge message to a XML format ( not yet needed )
  ** route message based on source to be able to apply different procedures
  ** complex event processing to filter messages
 * datacenter functionality to
  **  store filtered / receiver data in a Postgresql

Communication between edge and controller, as well as controller internal communication
is implemented via JMS messaging.

=== Temperature Sensor
This dummy sensor is implemented in a very simple but generic
way. As of now, it works with the following steps:

 1. start with an initial value ( 70 in this case )
 2. send data record via JMS to Controller
 3. alter data
   * get random number between 1 and 1000
   * if random number is <= 10 reduce data by 1
   * if random number is >= 990 increase data by 1
 4. back to 2.

=== Controller
The controller does the following

 1. receive data record via JMS
 2. transform data from sensor-specific format to xml ( not yet required )
 3. route data based on sensor type
 4. use complex event processing ( CEP ) to filter messages. Currently we only
       have one rule, which deletes messages if the value is the same as in the
       previous message.
 5. send data record via JMS to datacenter

All functionality for the controller is implemented with http://www.redhat.com/de/technologies/jboss-middleware/fuse-service-works[Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works], with every step packaged in its own container.

=== Datacenter
As for now, the datacenter is implemented with the following service,
each running in it's own container

 1. receive messages from the controller
 2. store the received data in a database ( Postgresql )
 3. forward message to a monitor, who checks the data if an alert needs to be raised

== Runtime Environment
The entire functionality is divided into various services, each running in its
own Docker container.

== Prerequisites

=== Dockerhost
The entire demo is build on https://www.docker.com/[Docker]. The various elements all run in their own container.

Please do follow the instructions on how to install Docker on your host, based on the https://docs.docker.com/installation/[relevant pages] from Docker.com

=== Docker Compose
For the first time I have used docker-compose as a tool to help me getting things up and running.
To be honest, it helped a lot.

Please follow the instructions on https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker-Compose] on how to install docker-compose on your system.

=== Maven
As our installation procedure will build a few jars for you convenience,
please do have the appropriate tools up and running on your Docker host.


== Building the Demo Environment

=== Getting the code

The procedure to build the various requried Docker container has been automated for your convenience,
all you need to do is to clone the most current version of the demo from github
----
git clone https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/Iot_Demo_Fuse
----

=== Providing the Red Hat JBoss Products
I have not included the various JBoss products in the git repository, so it will be your obligation to retrieve them and to place them in their directories.

	* `jboss-fuse-full-6.1.1.redhat-412.zip` into `./Fuse/Docker_Files/software`

=== Building the demo
I have tried to make the deployment of the entire IoT Demo as convenient as possibe.
All you need to do is

  * make sure you have all required pre-requisites
  * downloaded and places the Red Hat JBoss Fuse installable
  * run `./build.sh`

== Starting the environment

Once you have completed the previous step, you can run the demo in your own
environment. Simply use `./docker-compose up` to start all images with the
required parameter and configurations.

After successful launch of all container, you can use your browser to view
the following dashboads

[width="80%",frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|URL | Service | User / Password
|http://localhost:10000/hawtio | Controller-Receiver Management Console | admin / admin
|http://localhost:10001/hawtio | Controller-Router Management Console | admin / admin
|http://localhost:10002/hawtio | Controller-Temperature Management Console | admin / admin
|http://localhost:10003/hawtio | Datacenter-Receiver Management Console | admin / admin
|http://localhost/phpPgAdmin/ | phpPGAdmin on DB-Server | psteiner / change12_me
|======================

== Creating testdata
I have tried to create a "general purpose" producer. As of now, he will produce
values based on a simple structure

----
@XmlRootElement(name = "dataSet")
@XmlType(propOrder = { "timestamp", "deviceType", "deviceID", "payload","required" })
public class DataSet {
	private String	timestamp;
	private int		deviceType;
	private int		deviceID;
	private	int		payload;
	private int		required;
----

There are system properties which you can use to alter the behavior of the client

[width="80%",frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|Name | Function | Default
|deviceType | Type of device to simulate | 1
|deviceID | ID of device to simulate | 1
|initialValue | value to start simulation with | 70
|count | How many messages to produce | 1
|waitime | Seconds to wait between messages | 1
|======================

For convenience I created a small script `run.sh` which you can use
to start the creation and delivery of

 * 10 messages
 * deviceType = 1, temperature gauge
 * deviceID = 1
 * waitTime = 1

If you want to change the data, please feel free to do so. Up until now, the
Controller-Router will understand the following device types:

[width="80%",frame="topbot",options="header,footer"]
|======================
|ID | Name | Behavior in Demo
|0 | pressure-gauge | will be stored in `message.to.pressure` on Router-Container
|1 | temperature-gauge | will be fully processed
|any other | unknown device | will be stored in `message.to.unknown` on Router-Container
|======================


= To Do

 * Update the producer to create more datasets, probably via an environment variable
 * Create some real CEP rules
 * Add the Datacenter-Layer with

   ** Database
   ** Human processes
   ** Dashboard
 * Add MQTT based edge
